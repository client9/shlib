# uname_os converts `uname -s` into standard golang OS types
# golang types are used since they cover
# most platforms and are standardized while raw uname values vary
# wildly.  See complete list of values by running
# "go tool dist list"
#
# ## EXAMPLE
#
# ```bash
# OS=$(uname_os)
# ```
#
uname_os() {
  os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

  # fixed up for https://github.com/client9/shlib/issues/3
  case "$os" in
    msys_nt) os="windows" ;;
  esac

  # other fixups here
  echo "$os"
}
